Chicken Tender is designed to help two people find a common ground on where/ what to eat. Person 1 starts and fills out
the appropriate forms. Person 2 makes the final decision.


Chicken Tender will stop any unwanted frustration and save time between two people on where to eat out.


To get started, accept the location tracker and fill out the users names. From there user 1 selects the style, price, and 
distance. This generates 10 restaurants through a yelp api. User 1 will have the option to like or dislike each location. 
Once 3 locations are chosen, user 2 will be able to select the final location.
